**Crime Data Analysis in India**

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing crime data in different states of India over the years. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and scikit-learn.

**Dataset**

The dataset (2001-2012NEW.csv) consists of crime statistics for various types of cases in different states and union territories of India from 2001 to 2012.

**Getting Started**

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crime-data-analysis.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd crime-data-analysis

3.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

Open the Jupyter Notebook (crime_data_analysis.ipynb) to view the code and perform further analysis.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the results.
Customize the code as needed for your specific analysis or use case.

**Note**

Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
The analysis includes the use of machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine) for predicting crime data.
